      <h2>FLAVORS OF FANTASY</h2>
      <p>
        With a few quick rules tweaks, you can shift the base assumptions of Grimwild over to other
        genres of fantasy, or just more to your table‚Äôs liking.
      </p>
      <h3>GRIMDARK</h3>
      <p>
        Bleak, brutal, and unforgiving. A world of moral ambiguity, harsh realities, and the
        constant threat of ruin.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>PCs can‚Äôt cast potent spells.</li>
        <li>Make a 1d story roll when dropped.</li>
        <li>Marks only clear on rest, not when rolled.</li>
        <li>Vex responses are random.</li>
        <li>PC bonds are rolled randomly.</li>
        <li>Each PC has a 4d Supplies resource pool.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>LOW FANTASY</h3>
      <p>
        Grounded, often more cynical or realistic. Small-scale conflicts, limited or absent magic.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>PCs can‚Äôt cast potent spells.</li>
        <li>Make a 1d story roll when dropped.</li>
        <li>Emphasis placed on vigilance, especially hint.</li>
        <li>Social fallout from vex responses increased.</li>
        <li>Carry 4 + Brawn items. Small, 1/2 slot. Big, 2+ slots.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>SWORDS &amp; SORCERY</h3>
      <p>
        Adventurous, action-packed, and often pulpy. Glory, treasure hunting, and survival in
        dangerous worlds.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No spellcasting PCs allowed.</li>
        <li>Make a 1d story roll when dropped.</li>
        <li>Clear marks and harm after any intense scene.</li>
        <li>Vex happens more often, but social fallout from vex responses is lessened.</li>
        <li>Each PC has a 4d Renown campaign timer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>HEROIC FANTASY</h3>
      <p>Inspirational and adventurous, with a focus on self-discovery and the hero‚Äôs journey.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Default Grimwild rules.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>NOBLEBRIGHT</h3>
      <p>
        Optimistic, hopeful, and virtuous. Good triumphs over evil, and the world can be made
        better.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>PCs begin at 2nd level with 1 minor arcana.</li>
        <li>Make a 3d story roll when dropped.</li>
        <li>PCs only die when the player agrees.</li>
        <li>Default damage is a mark, not harm.</li>
        <li>Rattled clears after any intense scene.</li>
        <li>Social fallout from vex responses heightened.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>HIGH FANTASY</h3>
      <p>
        Epic and grand, often with a sense of wonder. Cosmic conflicts, destinies, and large-scale
        battles.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>PCs begin at 3rd level with 2 minor arcana or 1 major arcana.</li>
        <li>Mooks and toughs require no roll to take out.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>COZY FANTASY</h3>
      <p>
        Wholesome, heartwarming, and low-stakes. Focused on friendship, personal growth, and simple
        joys in a magical world.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Default is tame stakes. Normal must be declared.</li>
        <li>Default damage is a mark, not harm.</li>
        <li>XP only earned if one of your bonds changed or arcs finished that session.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>GM TOOLS</h2>
      <p>
        GM Tools are extensions of the GM Toolkit‚Äîoptional extras to enhance your game. They might
        not be for every GM, but you may find them useful. Experiment with these ideas and see if
        they stick in your repertoire!
      </p>
      <h3>FICTION PILLARS</h3>
      <p>
        Fiction pillars is a method of preparation that lets you create ready-made blocks of
        fiction, giving you a sturdier foundation than pure off-the-cuff improvisation. These
        ‚Äúpillars‚Äù serve as anchors for the improv storytelling that unfolds during a session,
        helping you maintain consistency and confidence in your game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moxie works well with little to no prep, but for those who see prep as play, or who want an
        extra layer of confidence at the table, fiction pillars are an excellent way to offload some
        of the pressure of in-the-moment creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before a session, imagine and detail 7 elements that might possibly come up in that session.
        These can be key NPCs, important locations, items, encounters, or events. Anything works.
      </p>
      <p>
        During play, we can sprinkle in these pillars to act as reinforced parts of the fiction to
        hang the rest of our fiction off of. They reside more vividly in our mind. You can keep any
        unused ones and repurpose them for later sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose all 7 elements first. Add sensory details‚Äî sights, sounds, and smells. Define what
        each wants to happen, or its pull on the story for nonsentient elements. Then set what it
        doesn‚Äôt want. Note one way to embody it at the table as the GM, like a behavior or sound
        effect. Keep everything short‚Äîjust a few words (as below) per detail. Skip any steps you
        draw a blank on and make final notes if you have anything left to add.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>HARVEST FESTIVAL</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wants everyone to leave with full bellies.</li>
          <li>Doesn‚Äôt want arguments about winter or toil.</li>
          <li>vibrant banners, overflowing carts, bonfires at dusk</li>
          <li>laughter and music, creak of carts, rustle of leaves</li>
          <li>roasted corn, spiced cider, damp post-harvest soil</li>
          <li>bite an apple, play a flute, raise a mug</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The key is that you activate your imagination beforehand so the pillars feel more vivid and
        real.
      </p>
      <h3>TOKEN INITIATIVE</h3>
      <p>
        Token initiative allows you to strike a balance between the normally free-flowing scenes of
        Moxie and a structured turn system. In this approach, there‚Äôs no set turn order. Instead,
        players are given tokens to represent the ‚Äúcamera time‚Äù they have to act within a scene. At
        the start of an intense moment, give each player 2 tokens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each major beat requires a player to spend a token before it begins, often an action roll.
        Play goes around until all are out of tokens, then players regain their tokens and it begins
        again. Everyone is ensured the same amount of screen time.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the GM, you can also take tokens. They have no mechanical meaning, but they do serve to
        remind you to interject with moments of the world moving. These aren‚Äôt spending suspense or
        impact moves, just story moves or other descriptions that help bring the scene to life.
      </p>
      <h3>ENEMY TACTICS</h3>
      <p>
        Make sure each enemy role brings a unique dynamic to a combat. To help, you can use the
        templates below as a simple basis for traits and moves, or even assign them alongside a
        monster entry. These are broken up in finer detail than monster entries, with three traits
        split into two strengths (+) and one weakness (-) as well as three moves split into one
        offensive ‚öî, one defensive üõ°, and one utility ‚ú®. Additionally, each role features a d6
        table with creative ideas for how to spend suspense in response to common worst-case
        scenarios that role encounters.
      </p>

      <blockquote>

          battlefield. However, they crumble when the fight gets too close.

        Great characters are defined by the details. Adding meaningful details gives more to build
        upon, providing hooks for development and collaboration. Details should inspire creativity
        without being overly prescriptive. Aim to create opportunities for collaboration and bring
        vividness to your PC.
      </p>
      <h3>GROUP-BUILDING QUESTIONS</h3>
      <p>
        During session zero after you‚Äôve introduced your characters, or at interesting moments in a
        campaign, ask one of the following questions to the person on your right and left. Keep the
        questions leading and juicy, to give something interesting for you both to latch onto. You
        can also use these questions to delve into details about their character that you‚Äôre
        interested in hearing more about.

      <h3>DISTINCTIVE FEATURES</h3>
      <p>
        Choosing three very great distinctive features helps cement your character not only in your
        mind, but also in the shared imagination space at the table. You can come back to your
        features again and again during scenes to add them in to paint the scene. Be open to change
        as well over time.

        <p>INGENUITY (CORE TALENT)</p>
        <p>
          You harness the power of creativity. Begin play with 1 minor arcana and 1 major arcana,
          chosen from those on pg. 150 onwards or work with the GM to create your own arcana. You do
          not have talents‚Äîinstead choose a gadget from your path list or reflavor a non-path talent
          as a gadget. Others can use your gadgets but take +1t and must always roll to use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When given time, you can pull off potent feats of mechanical ingenuity like crafting a
          temporary device without proper materials or combining arcana and gadgets for wild
          effects. You can push yourself to do it on the spot.
        </p>

      <h4>ARTIFICER GADGETS</h4>
      <p>ANCHORSHOT</p>
      <p>
        You have a hook, harpoon, and rope contraption that anchors large monsters to the ground.
        With it, you have potency to hinder the movement of anything elephant-sized or larger. When
        hit, the target becomes 4d Tethered. It anchors to the ground so you can leave it.
      </p>
      <p>AUTOMATONS</p>
      <p>
        You have three small helpers you created. Each has a different descriptor, an adjective that
        determines what tasks they can do. Each session, each has a 2d power pool you roll to
        perform tasks. When assisting, they roll 1d of their pool. They can follow simple commands,
        without which they will simply search for you.
      </p>
      <p>DOUBLE-BARRELED BLUNDERBUSS</p>
      <p>
        You have a firearm that fires specialized, crafted ammo. You get one shot of each per
        session. When you shoot, choose the ammo: blast core‚Äîdrill shot‚Äîinferno shot‚Äîscatter
        shot‚Äîshrapnel burst‚Äîtangler shot. Each shot has a secondary or collateral effect related to
        the type. You can fire two ammo types at the same time for a potent shot.
      </p>
      <p>GRENADES</p>
      <p>
        Each session, you have a 4d Grenades resource pool. You have access to the following bombs:
        choking‚Äîflashbang‚Äîglue‚Äîsmoke‚Äîstink. Bombs can affect multiple targets or an area even
        without potency. You can drop 1 and roll the pool to have a potent grenade.
      </p>
      <p>MECHANICAL MOUNT</p>
      <p>
        You have a small mechanical vehicle, like a steamwork spider or smoke-belching cart. It has
        three features: all-terrain‚Äîarmored‚Äîburrowing‚Äîgrappling hook‚Äîsubmergible‚Äîturbo boost. You
        can activate each perk once per session to pull off a potent feat of piloting. It also has
        one drawback: conspicuous‚Äîhorrifying‚Äîslow‚Äîunreliable.
      </p>
      <p>STEAMHAMMER</p>
      <p>
        You have a large steam-infused warhammer. Each session, you have a 6d Steamhammer power
        pool. You can roll the pool to pull off potent feats of pulverizing force. You can also not
        expend its steam to use it as a normal warhammer.
      </p>
      <p>SWIFTWING</p>
      <p>
        You have highly maneuverable wings that allow you to glide (not fly). You gain a 3d resource
        pool while aloft, or 4d if you have extreme height or speed. You must roll the pool as bonus
        dice with any physical roll made while aloft, including defenses. At 0d, you coast back to
        the ground.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Note: If a gadget or arcana is ever lost, you can re-create one of them during any downtime.
        They take effort, but you remember the schematics.
      </p>
      <h3>PSION</h3>
      <p>ALSO: Mentalist, Seer, Telepath</p>
      <p>
        You unlock the limitless power of the mind, bending thought, will, and reality through focus
        and discipline.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>AWAKENED MIND (CORE TALENT)</p>
        <p>
          You have spellcasting ability. Choose 2 bastions below, which act as touchstones for your
          psionic magic. You roll two stats combined to cast, forming the roll by adding the
          bastion‚Äôs key stats (below) and subtracting two (3 Brawn and 2 Wits = 3d).
        </p>
        <p>
          Each session, you have 8 power points. Spend 1 power point to cast a spell. You can
          augment it by spending 1 or more points to: cast a potent spell‚Äîtake +1d (max once) on the
          roll‚Äîignore thorns from damage‚Äîadd another of your bastions as a touchstone.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>GROWTH: Every 2 levels, learn a new bastion and gain 2 power points per session.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>BASTIONS</p>
      <p>
        Within your mind lie bastions of psionic power. As you grow stronger, you break down their
        walls, unlocking your true potential. These powers take shape as visions, psychic phenomena,
        and even physical manifestations in the form of ectoplasm‚Äîpure essence of creation.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h4>PSION TALENTS</h4>
      <p>DISTURBED MIND</p>
      <p>
        Your presence is highly disturbing to others. The GM judges an NPC‚Äôs response, or you can
        spend story to set it: agitated‚Äîfractured‚Äîparanoid‚Äîrepulsed. Once per session when you would
        take vex, a nearby sentient creature‚Äîeven an ally‚Äîmust instead take a vex response.
      </p>
      <p>MIND SEED</p>
      <p>
        When you plant thoughts or alter memories in someone‚Äôs head, you can always choose to have
        them take effect exactly when you want them to. You can decide this at any time later. Once
        per session, you can use this for an interrupt.
      </p>
      <p>MIND THIEF</p>
      <p>
        On a critical on a bastion roll, refund the power points spent and gain 3 power points. This
        causes mental collateral damage around you: confusion‚Äîhallucinations‚Äî headaches‚Äî panic. One
        time only, you can make this a ritual-level effect, affecting all within miles.
      </p>
      <p>PSYCHIC WARRIOR</p>
      <p>
        On a perfect with a feat of martial prowess, spend no power points and take +1d on an
        immediate follow-up with a bastion. You can‚Äôt follow-up with a bastion you just used.
      </p>
      <p>READER</p>
      <p>
        You gain 1 story per session and can spend story when you first meet someone to know their
        foremost surface thought‚Äîthey are like an open book to you. If you follow-up on it, it
        counts as a setup.
      </p>
      <p>TUMULTUOUS MIND</p>
      <p>
        You can spend 2 power points to gain potency on any Wits or Presence defense roll.
        Regardless of the roll, if the attacker is sentient, you can interrupt their next impact
        move.
      </p>
      <p>WILDER</p>
      <p>
        Your powers are inherently chaotic, either by nature or nurture, and you struggle to control
        them. Take +1d, but also +1t, on all psionic bastion rolls. You can never ignore thorns from
        any source, including by using your core talent. On a critical, regain the power points you
        just spent.
      </p>
      <h2>VARIOUS ARCANA</h2>
      <p>
        Arcana are items imbued with magical power, covered on pg. 23. Below are some example arcana
        to use with your campaigns or look at as a basis for crafting your own. Their power and
        purpose lie in their magnitude, descriptions, touchstones, and limitations, which govern
        their usage. They are not limited to only their descriptions, but when outside of them, each
        of their touchstones must be applied. If a roll is ever needed and not supplied, use a
        relevant stat or make a story roll.
      </p>
      <h3>MINOR ARCANA</h3>
      <p>
        Minor arcana are capable of casting cantrips or performing magic just shy of a full spell‚Äôs
        power. Despite their limited abilities, they remain rare‚Äîfew mages bother to create them
        unless driven by personal passion or experimentation. Their value lies not in their power,
        but in their utility.

      <h2>SOLO PLAY</h2>
      <p>
        Just as Grimwild assumes knowledge of roleplaying games in general, it also assumes
        knowledge about solo and duet style play. If unfamiliar, there are plenty of resources
        online to figure it out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The base rules for Grimwild are already very well-suited for solo RPGs. There are plenty of
        difficulty changes on pg. 137 as well for you to adjust the game, but let‚Äôs look at why
        Grimwild works out of the box.
      </p>
      <p>
        The roll resolution system brings both the PC‚Äôs actions and the world into one single roll.
        This cuts down on the need for back-and-forth dice rolls. One roll can convey a lot‚Äîit lets
        you play out a beat, a sequence of beats, or even an entire scene based on the results. The
        thorns, setups, and assists are rolled separately as well, giving you important information
        on what to narrate in the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        Montages zoom out even further. Playing solo, you know very well what you do and don‚Äôt want
        to play out in detail‚Äîyou can set the perfect scope for the story you want to play out.
        Montage rolls can perfectly fill those times and connect the story together seamlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Challenges zoom in even further. When there‚Äôs something you really want to see play out, lay
        it out as a challenge. The prep exercise for it will help you paint the scene to come, as
        well as putting yourself in the GM‚Äôs perspective for enough time to view the story
        objectively. Then play it out and see what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        GM moves are structured, intuitive guidance for the world. Baked right into the moves is
        advice and principles on how the world, as a cinematic entity, should operate. When in
        doubt, it gives you 15 different scenarios to look at for how to move forward. Suspense also
        helps reminds you that the world has teeth so you don‚Äôt get too wrapped up in your own
        character.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crucibles are a perfect source of outside inspiration. They allow you to disclaim
        decision-making and go where they point you. Your mind will gravitate towards what sounds
        the most fun while you‚Äôre rolling them. It jumpstarts your creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Story arcs give you a clear way to create purpose for your character. Just set an arc, then
        work towards hitting it. The ideas are all typical character tropes and can be taken in many
        different directions. When your character accomplishes or outgrows one, just set another
        that‚Äôs more important to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advancement is done on a per-session basis, simple for solo play. However, you can also
        split this up into smaller bursts. Solo roleplaying sometimes takes the form of micro-play,
        so 2 hours worth of total play is a good marker for one XP.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exploration system is perfectly suited for solo play. It‚Äôs designed to surprise a group
        of players and bring their ideas into a somewhat cohesive whole. The canon-less setting of
        Grimwild thrives on spontaneity, making it simple to weave together a randomly generated
        story without too much mental gymnastics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monster blocks, combined with the tactics blocks, make combats dynamic. They come with
        plenty of ideas to bring to bear during a fight. Their wants and doesn‚Äôt wants will
        naturally drive you towards following through with them logically. The additional table at
        the bottom allows you to add some extra randomness to each on the fly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Story kits work differently than with a group and GM, but just as well. You just don‚Äôt
        answer the questions, change some of the Mix It Up details to randomize them, and away you
        go. There‚Äôs an entire structure for you to play off of, with a limited amount of concrete
        foundation leaving huge swathes of gray area in between to fill with your own imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        The story roll captures everything. When unsure what happens next, assess the likelihood,
        ask, and roll. Grimwild‚Äôs design fosters flow and progress from top to bottom, ideal for
        solo play.
      </p>
      <h3>SOLO PARTY MODE</h3>
      <p>
        In Grimwild, solo play is clear with the rules as written, but you can also play as a party.
        In this mode, your primary character, the PC, remains the main focus of the story, while the
        other three party members are simplified secondary characters. This approach lets you create
        the social dynamics of an adventuring party without overwhelming complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main PC is created as normal, while the secondary party members are streamlined. They
        have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A single talent and don‚Äôt advance.</li>
        <li>Simplified harm, with no marks.</li>
        <li>One positive trait and desire along with a negative one.</li>
        <li>No character arcs.</li>
        <li>No spark or story.</li>
        <li>Only backgrounds listed, no wises.</li>
        <li>Only bonds with the PC.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This simplicity keeps their power level lower than the main PC, shaping the story while
        keeping gameplay manageable. You only need to remember a few talents, roll their stats, and
        use them as supporting NPCs in your roleplay.
      </p>
      <p>
        This system allows you to balance personal character arcs with a broader group dynamic. It
        also opens up opportunities for group conflicts or challenges, pushing the story in
        unexpected and engaging directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can copy the sheet on this page to use for each secondary character or even just as a
        single sidekick. You can also download the sheet in US letter size with 3 character blocks
        on it at odditypress.com.

      <h2>DESIGNER NOTES</h2>
      <p>
        In finishing this book, I had a bit more to say, so the following are a random collection of
        thoughts on Grimwild, and the gameplay and design process of this game from myself, J.D.
        Maxwell. These are long and a bit self-indulgent, but it really made me feel better getting
        these last thoughts in.
      </p>
      <h3>THE RULES AS A NET</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the game, you‚Äôll find a steady mix of narrativist and gamist mechanics. You‚Äôll
        see me pushing towards adding story, to be followed up with fun fiddly bits to play with.
        During character creation and party setup, the game leans heavily into those narrative
        elements. We‚Äôre not bogged down with detailed tracking‚Äîgear is abstracted, skills
        represented through Vantages, and simple stats give us quick resolution. The focus here is
        on moving the story forward rather than digging into simulationist depth. But later, as the
        rules around adventuring kick in, the gamist elements come into play. Manipulating dice
        pools, adding thorns, assisting‚Äîthese are mechanics designed to elegantly capture the
        fiction and break down towards simplicity.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúThe game thrives on fiction. The rules don‚Äôt push the story forward on their own‚Äîthey
          depend on the fiction to drive the game.‚Äù
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The rules act like a layer of nets sitting under the story, just waiting to catch it. As we
        describe what‚Äôs happening at the table, the rules get out of your way. They‚Äôre not demanding
        you to do anything, they‚Äôre just sitting underneath and waiting. Then when we hit a point
        where we don‚Äôt know what comes next or how something turns out, they‚Äôre there for us. They
        catch the fiction as it falls, spin up their mechanisms, help us along the way, and push us
        right back into the story.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the very top of this layer of nets are specific rules. Talents are a great example of
        this. If a fighter has the Bulwark talent and rolls a messy that would normally lead to them
        getting bloodied, Bulwark steps in. It catches the fiction first, overrides the general
        rules (later nets), and tells us what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        The layers then go from specific to less specific. The real elegance of it lies in what‚Äôs at
        the very bottom‚Äîthe story roll. It‚Äôs the catch-all when nothing else fits. If you don‚Äôt know
        what rule to use, or don‚Äôt want to stop and look something up, you can always just make a
        story roll. It keeps the game flowing.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          It means you can‚Äôt engage with the mechanics until you describe what your character is
          doing in the fiction. The mechanics can‚Äôt do anything until you‚Äôve given them some
          fiction.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The game thrives on fiction. The rules don‚Äôt push the story forward on their own‚Äîthey depend
        on the fiction to drive the game. There‚Äôs that great phrase from Apocalypse World: ‚ÄúTo do
        it, do it.‚Äù It means you can‚Äôt engage with the mechanics until you describe what your
        character is doing in the fiction. The mechanics can‚Äôt do anything until you‚Äôve given them
        some fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        That applies in Grimwild, too‚Äîthis is the very nature of fiction-first and narrative gaming.
        But here‚Äôs my addition on that phrase: don‚Äôt do all of it until after the roll, after the
        mechanics. Before the roll, the player describes their intentions and how they‚Äôre going
        about it, but leaves room for the dice to decide what happens and picks up narration again
        after the roll.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a key part of the game. The GM isn‚Äôt there to dictate how the action plays out after
        the roll; they work with the player to do that, and the dice give you guidelines on where
        the story can go. It‚Äôs up to the player to follow through on their earlier setup and bring
        it to life in the fiction. So while I love ‚Äúto do it, do it‚Äù, I‚Äôd tweak it slightly: Do it,
        but don‚Äôt finish doing it until after the roll.
      </p>
      <h3>STARTING A CAMPAIGN</h3>
      <p>
        At the very start of the first session‚Äîafter the players have come up with their characters
        and figured out the general concept of the party, but before they‚Äôve nailed down any bonds‚ÄîI
        like to go around the table and dig into their characters. I‚Äôll start with one player and
        ask, ‚ÄúTell us about your character. What do they look like?‚Äù As they talk, I‚Äôm jotting down
        notes‚Äîmostly just to help me remember names and key details. I also make sure to tell them,
        ‚ÄúWhile I‚Äôm taking notes, talk to the group, not to me.‚Äù This establishes quickly that this
        game isn‚Äôt a 1-on-1 conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        As they explain, I‚Äôll ask follow-up questions. If they say something like, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a wiry
        woman with rough hands,‚Äù I‚Äôll jump in: ‚ÄúRough hands? What‚Äôs that about? Years of hard work?‚Äù
        I try to find those little things they seem to care about‚Äîmaybe they already have an idea,
        or maybe they don‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs fun for them to think about. We talk about their traits: who
        they are, who they aren‚Äôt, what they desire, and what they don‚Äôt. Honestly, the stuff the
        PCs aren‚Äôt and don‚Äôt desire are often the most interesting. Like, if they want power but
        don‚Äôt care about wealth, I‚Äôll ask, ‚ÄúWhy not wealth? That‚Äôs often tied to power? Did
        something happen to make them averse to gathering wealth? Are they even aware they don‚Äôt
        care about it?‚Äù These kinds of questions are open-ended and a bit leading‚Äîhitting them with
        a question that doesn‚Äôt fit can spur them into giving an answer that does fit. And if they
        don‚Äôt really have an answer? Let it go. It‚Äôs obviously not important to their character
        concept.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          While they‚Äôre talking, I‚Äôm keeping an eye out for connections‚Äîlittle dots we can use to
          draw lines between characters and drill deeper with questions.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Once they‚Äôve said their piece and run out of steam, I move on to the next player and do the
        same thing. While they‚Äôre talking, I‚Äôm keeping an eye out for connections‚Äîlittle dots we can
        use to draw lines between characters and drill deeper with questions. Maybe two of them both
        want power, but it‚Äôs not the same kind of power. Or one avoids wealth, and the other craves
        it. These differences and similarities can help explain why they‚Äôre adventuring together‚Äîor
        make you wonder why they would be. That‚Äôs where you can nudge them with a question: ‚ÄúIs this
        the kind of power that overlaps, or are you stepping on each other‚Äôs toes?‚Äù
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I pick one per player to dig a little bit deeper on‚Äî‚ÄúHow long‚Äôs that complex rivalry been
          going on for? When did they recently get the better of you?‚Äù
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This should all be a big group conversation, moving the spotlight around. As the GM, point
        it at players, but watch for creativity waning and shift focus when needed. Come back to
        them later. Players can pass or grab the spotlight when they have something to contribute,
        otherwise, let the discussion flow naturally. On pg. 142, you‚Äôll find questions to help
        connect characters. Players can share these, but the GM will likely ask the most, steering
        the conversation while others develop their ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of this whole back-and-forth, I ask the players about their bonds. Some might‚Äôve
        already written them out, but this is their chance to tweak or rethink them now that they‚Äôve
        heard about the other characters in detail. It‚Äôs usually pretty organic‚Äîbonds tend to pop up
        naturally during the conversation. I pick one bond per player to dig a little bit deeper
        on‚Äî‚ÄúHow long‚Äôs that complex rivalry been going on for? When did they recently get the better
        of you?‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my favorite parts is asking about their last adventure: ‚ÄúWhat was the last thing you
        all did together?‚Äù A spark from the character discussion‚Äîan item, goal, or moment‚Äîkicks
        things off, and we build a quick montage from there. This is why you make characters
        together and leave open spaces. In 30-45 minutes, they‚Äôve created a shared history full of
        dots we can connect as we move along. It already feels like they‚Äôve been adventuring
        together for some time.
      </p>
      <h3>THE ROLE OF THE DICE</h3>
      <p>
        Something I get asked a lot is why thorns are d8s, and what the thought process behind
        including them is. They ask, ‚ÄúWhy not just use d6s?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy not just reduce the number of
        base dice to represent difficulty?‚Äù There‚Äôs a few reasons for this, and it‚Äôs all tied to the
        dice system as a whole, so I‚Äôll break it down here.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I first designed thorns, they used a matching mechanic‚Äîif a thorn matched one of your
        base dice, that die got knocked out, and 7s and 8s trumped your dice no matter what, causing
        a failure. It worked on paper well enough, but was clunky at the table. It took way too long
        to parse, slowing things down, and killing the flow. Flow is everything in Moxie. However
        what I did like about it was the 7s and 8s beating any other dice. That felt right!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          When parsing the dice, the higher results pull the eye quickly too, letting their presence
          be known before figuring out the rest of the roll.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        So now you might be wondering why thorns are d8s instead of d4s. After all, the odds of
        rolling a 7-8 on a d8 are the same as 4 on a d4. First off, d4s are just awful to roll.
        They‚Äôre hard to pick up. They feel awkward in your hand. They‚Äôre just unsatisfying all
        around. On the other hand, d8s feel great. They stand out visually from the d6 base dice and
        it‚Äôs a nice bonus that their jagged edges look like a thorn, too. When parsing the dice, the
        higher results pull the eye quickly too, letting their presence be known before figuring out
        the rest of the roll. Multiple 4s being rolled would just slow that parsing down again. And
        of course, there‚Äôs the idea of the 7-8 beating 6 and under, reinforcing the idea of thorns
        overriding results.
      </p>
      <p>
        So why not just cut dice? They‚Äôre separate because they give us more narrative clarity. If a
        perfect is cut to a messy by a thorn, we know the thorn caused whatever bad thing happened!
        But if the roll was messy to start with, and the thorn didn‚Äôt cut, it‚Äôs clear the issue
        wasn‚Äôt from whatever added that thorn. This is great when interpreting results. The more
        information we have, the better the picture we paint with our narration is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine if there‚Äôs a really strong wind and you take +1t while trying to shoot a goblin with
        your bow. If the thorn cuts, we know the wind caused that problem. If not, we can guess it
        was just a miss, the goblin was jukey, or some other factor‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt the wind.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          If a player‚Äôs assisting you, they roll that +1d instead of just adding it to your pool.
          This way, we get to see how much of the outcome was from your effort and how much was from
          theirs.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This same thing holds true for assists, setups, and outside assistance. If a player‚Äôs
        assisting you, they roll that +1d instead of just adding it to your pool. This way, we get
        to see how much of the outcome was from your effort and how much was from theirs. All of
        this adds extra layers to each beat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The actual act of rolling the dice as well matters with how this all feels. Here‚Äôs a
        tip‚Äîwhen multiple people are rolling, make sure the main player rolls first. This keeps the
        focus on them and we get their outcome first. Then let other dice go, feeling like they‚Äôre
        adding to the action, not taking it over.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, the dice system is designed to be easy to parse, satisfying to roll, and give us
        some extra information when other dice are in play. It all flows together, helping the dice
        tell the story without getting in the way.
      </p>
      <h3>VIGILANCE &amp; PERCEPTION CHECKS</h3>
      <p>
        When you first come across the rules for vigilance, it probably feels a bit jarring. It
        stands apart from the rest of the game by relying more on player skill than character skill.
        That was an intentional choice though, and one meant to grab your attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem, as I see it, is an overcautiousness with players. Adventurers are naturally
        wary, sure. They face traps and monsters regularly. But when the players, not the
        characters, spend time poking every nook, prodding every surface, and hesitating at every
        step, it grinds the cinematic flow of the game to a halt. That style might fit some games
        and the experience they‚Äôre going for, but Grimwild isn‚Äôt built for it. Grimwild‚Äôs built to
        flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rules already address how unexpected dangers affect the PCs. Impact moves handle
        surprises and talents can interrupt those moves, giving a framework without requiring excess
        caution. By the rules, there‚Äôs nothing a player can make their PC do to be extra
        cautious‚Äîthe GM can hit at any time, as long as it‚Äôs logical. We give that authority, of
        deciding just how cautious a PC is right then or whether they‚Äôve made a mistake, over to the
        GM, a sacrifice of player agency made to keep the game flowing smoothly.

        Vigilance complements this removal of simulationism by injecting it right when it matters.
        It leans into cinematic reactions and player engagement. Vigilance: hint is tied right to
        player skill. Players listen to the GM‚Äôs and other players‚Äô descriptions, weigh the
        situation, and react as best they can. They keep their character in mind, but it‚Äôs largely a
        player guessing game, a simulationist mechanic right in the middle of the game‚Äôs narrativist
        core. So why include it? Because it‚Äôs fun and creates memorable scenes. Because it‚Äôs
        cinematic. It captures moments of tension and immediacy, letting players respond viscerally
        both as themselves and through their characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach has two main benefits. First, it sparks that genuine player reaction. That‚Äôs
        the good stuff, and injects it right into the fiction. Second, it encourages players to
        focus on the details at the table. OSR games excel at this level of focus‚Äîplayers are locked
        into the fiction, absorbing everything, because if they miss something, it could spell their
        doom. Vigilance: hint brings a big chunk of that magic into Grimwild.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here‚Äôs the key point: there are no perception checks in the game. The GM decides what
        characters notice, based on their knowledge of the character, situation, and story. This
        trust in the GM fosters a better flowing story. Instead of rolling to notice things, players
        focus on the fiction and what they‚Äôll get to add to it next. They enjoy the scenes and set
        up great moments. If you want to play a highly observant character, there are talents to
        represent that.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This blend‚Äînarrativist with a tiny bit of simulationist in there at just the right
        spot‚Äîmakes Vigilance unique. It breaks from the core mechanics just enough to really mean
        something while keeping the focus on the fiction. The result, or at least I think, is a
        system that rewards you for really paying attention to the fiction and thinking on how you
        can add to it, to stay engaged even when other people are describing things, all while
        producing cinematic moments. And best of all, it avoids that absolutely terrible habit of
        rolling to see if you see something.
      </p>
      <h3>STORY AND WHY IT MATTERS</h3>
      <p>
        The narrative currency in Grimwild, which I decided to call story because it‚Äôs as clear as
        day as to what it does, exists because the game belongs to everyone at the table. Of course
        the world largely resides in the GM‚Äôs mind, especially things offscreen, but it‚Äôs fun to get
        in there and add details to the fiction. I wanted everyone to have that ability, that
        freedom, so they help craft the scenes they really want to play out. And here‚Äôs the
        thing‚Äîwhile I love GMing games, I‚Äôm most excited about being a player. That‚Äôs how I view the
        game, through that player lens. I‚Äôm always thinking about what I want to be doing as a
        player. In the end, I made this game for me and just hope others will like it, and nothing
        gets me more excited than being able to add details to the fiction and then play off of them
        to make a cool scene.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Some players, especially coming from a traditional gaming background, can struggle a bit
        with story at first. If you‚Äôre GMing, nudge them a bit to use it. Remind them that they get
        it for free each session and it replenishes‚Äîit‚Äôs use it or lose it. For GMs too, it can be
        hard. Remember that you can always say no, and that you can also disclaim decision making by
        turning it into a story roll instead. Every GM will have different lines as to what‚Äôs okay
        and what‚Äôs not.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here‚Äôs the thing, though‚Äîthis kind of player-driven storytelling already exists in every
        RPG, just in a less formal way. If you walk into a tavern in most games, you might say, ‚ÄúI
        go up to the counter and order an ale.‚Äù You assume the bar has ale, even if the GM hasn‚Äôt
        explicitly told you. What story does is creating a system for adding larger details, to make
        everyone feel comfortable with doing so, and to provide some concrete limitations on it so
        players don‚Äôt push and pull the narrative to death. It‚Äôs as much a tool for limiting
        contributions as it is for promoting them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This all ties directly into your character‚Äôs backstory, traits, and story arcs. It creates
        more fluid, player-driven scenes where, instead of just asking the GM, ‚ÄúIs there a dice game
        in the tavern?‚Äù when you want to explore your ‚ÄúFeed Vices‚Äù story arc, you just spend a point
        of story and say, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a dice game, and I‚Äôm jumping in with our shiny new treasure as
        the stakes.‚Äù By spending story, you‚Äôre not just asking for something‚Äîyou‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúThis is
        important to me. I want it to matter in this scene.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        The GM decides how to respond. Maybe they just go with it, or maybe they want to add some
        nuance, like rolling for the gamblers to see how tough the competition is. On a perfect,
        these fellas know the game well. On a critical, they‚Äôre sharks looking for their next
        sucker‚Äîbut either way, the story becomes about the thing the player cares about. And since
        you only get two points per session, you balance those story spends, waiting to make sure
        it‚Äôll impact the scene in a way that‚Äôs satisfying while at the same time, there‚Äôs no reason
        to hoard them‚Äîthey refresh each session.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          By spending story, you‚Äôre not just asking for something‚Äîyou‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúThis is important
          to me. I want it to matter in this scene.‚Äù
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Story keeps the narrative flowing. When we set our story arcs, they expand our vantage. We
        can spend story to create scenarios to play out those arcs. We also let the group know when
        we set an arc‚Äîthis gives them a chance to buy in on your character doing that. If you choose
        ‚ÄúFeed Vices,‚Äù and then gamble away the party‚Äôs treasure, the group‚Äôs already had a chance to
        talk about whether that kind of thing is okay. They knew you were going down a dark path.
        They also have a chance here to quarrel with you to stop you from following through!
        Suddenly, the story shifts into something cinematic‚Äîa moment you‚Äôd see in a movie‚Äîand it all
        flows naturally because the system is built for it.
      </p>
      <h3>BUYING INTO QUARRELS</h3>
      <p>
        The quarrel mechanic might be a bit contentious, so I want to address it here at the end. I
        know that some players won‚Äôt like the idea of giving up their agency to the dice‚ÄîI‚Äôve seen
        it in playtesting. They‚Äôll want to be convinced, in-character and out, to take a different
        path. But here‚Äôs the problem: when two PCs are at odds, the story needs a resolution to keep
        moving forward. Both players naturally see their character as being in the right, and feel
        their character would never back down. In real life, disagreements like this could play out
        over minutes, hours, or even days. Why waste precious game time at the table watching two
        players argue about what their characters would or wouldn‚Äôt do?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          In my experience, arguing about something your characters are contentious about rarely
          (dare I say never?) feels satisfying.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        There‚Äôs also the issue of social dynamics. Some players are going to be better at convincing
        people, or more comfortable being assertive, while others might give in just to avoid
        conflict. This means one player could end up consistently losing these disagreements‚Äînot
        because their character would back down, but because they, as a player, don‚Äôt want to ruffle
        feathers or stall the game. In my experience, players arguing what their characters are
        contentious about rarely (dare I say never?) feels satisfying. One side inevitably feels bad
        about how it played out, or someone bends just to keep things moving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quarrels solve this by letting characters be stubborn and stand their ground without bogging
        the game down. They provide a quick resolution, are very simple without a lot of mechanical
        heft, and give the ‚Äúwinning‚Äù side narrative control over what happens next and the ‚Äúlosing‚Äù
        side the last word. The quotes on ‚Äúwinning‚Äù are important there‚Äîneither side really wins or
        loses. Both get a chance to add more fun narration to the game! The story moves in the
        direction the winner wants, but the losing side still gets to respond‚Äîand they even get the
        final word on the situation to set the tone on how things might play out moving forward.
        They decide whether their character agrees, begrudgingly goes along, or outright resents it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think about how this plays out in TV shows and movies. You often see characters who are tied
        together by the plot or personal bonds come to a major disagreement. One side inevitably
        ‚Äúwins,‚Äù but the tension lingers, and maybe there are some hard feelings or sharp words
        exchanged. The story moves forward because it has to. That‚Äôs what the quarrel mechanic is
        designed to emulate.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The most important thing about quarrels, though, is player buy-in. A quarrel can‚Äôt happen
          unless all at the table agree to it.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The roll itself is simple: both players roll 2d. This keeps things fair, with no character
        stats or approaches involved, because the assumption is that both sides are doing their
        absolute best to convince the other. It‚Äôs 2d instead of 1d so that others can assist and add
        a bit to it, but not as much as the main person pushing the point. There‚Äôs no mechanical
        consequences tied to the roll, either, unless they‚Äôre specifically agreed to beforehand. If
        the quarrel leads to a physical fight, for example, the game doesn‚Äôt punish the characters
        by inflicting wounds or conditions‚Äîbecause making players mechanically weaker for
        interacting with each other isn‚Äôt fun and nobody would do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important thing about quarrels, though, is player buy-in. A quarrel can‚Äôt happen
        unless all at the table agree to it. If someone doesn‚Äôt want to quarrel about some decision,
        the group needs to rethink the scenario together and come up with a solution. At this point,
        the game and story have hit an actual roadblock and out-of-character conversation is
        necessary. Quarrels pull double-duty here‚Äîthey let players signal that they don‚Äôt really
        care about something, but they also let them signal that they really do care about
        something. My advice to those skeptical is this: just try it.
