      <h2>EXPLORING THE GRIMWILD</h2>
      <p>
        Exploration is an adventure, and this pointcrawl system captures that spirit. It’s about
        venturing into the unknown, both as your characters and as players, uncovering what lies
        ahead. As you explore, connections form naturally, and a narrative begins to emerge—one
        built from your experiences and the discoveries you yourselves have added to the region.
        It’s discovery as PCs, but also as players, figuring out and creating a region together on
        the fly and finding the wonder and drama that lies within it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Grimwild is a completely optional campaign setting or exploration system you can bolt
        onto your own setting. You can base your game on it, use it only when needed, or forgo it
        entirely!
      </p>
      <h3>WHAT IS THE GRIMWILD?</h3>
      <p>
        The Grimwild is a chaotic wildland, a once sparsely populated borderland that was shattered
        by a cataclysm half a century ago. Within, three realities have collided—the original small
        towns and keeps, the ruins of a long-fallen empire, and a savage wilderness teeming with
        monsters. The Remnants, the Wilds, and the Ruins have fused into a surreal region that
        defies logic and strict canon, the three bleeding into each other across the Grimwild’s
        expanse. Old settlements have either adapted or vanished, and survivors live in a tenuously
        strange existence where a dragon might nest beneath a town or farmers inhabit an ancient
        wizard’s tower.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a long corridor spanning harsh terrain, a week’s ride east to west and twice that north
        to south— if the way were clear. Such territory is rare in the Grimwild. Sheer cliffs line
        the stormy eastern coast, jagged mountains rise to the west, and dense forests and swamps
        choke the north and south. Surrounding the borders is the fog, impossibly dense.
      </p>
      <p>
        To enter the fog and leave the Grimwild is to risk becoming lost forever, never knowing
        which of the three realities you will emerge into. Expeditions into and out of the region
        rarely returned. The borderland was written off as a cursed wasteland by those outside.
        Those inside have learned their present situation is better than the horrors of the other
        realms. The Grimwild is isolated, left to its own fate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Grimwild is a canon-less sandbox where you have the freedom to explore, discover, and
        make it all up as you go. Logical connections don’t matter here, giving you the freedom to
        add whatever sounds fun to your party and let a storyline emerge through play. It is a land
        of discovery, one even its own inhabitants don’t understand well.
      </p>
      <h2>THE THREE REALITIES</h2>
      <p>
        Below are some basic truths about the three realities that make up the Grimwild, a set of
        pillars for you to start building within and around. You can hang your own fiction off of
        them, or topple them over and create something totally different. The point is to make a
        sandbox that’s easy to play in.
      </p>
      <p>THE REMNANTS, Forgotten People of the Borderlands</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fiercely Independent: Long before the cata- clysm, the borderlands thrived as a melting
          pot of cultures, blending traditions into something uniquely their own.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scattered Settlements: Villages, homesteads, and the occasional keep dot the harsh land-
          scape, home to survivors who endure isolation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Simple Monsters: Orcs, goblins, and a few larger beasts lurk, but they’re nothing com-
          pared to the horrors of the ruinS and wildS.
        </li>
        <li>
          Blended Heritage: A patchwork of languages, customs, and traditions born from centuries of
          border nations mingling.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>THE WILDS, Untamed and Unforgiving Wilderness</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tribal Nomads: Scattered tribes thrive where others perish. Each tribe has its own
          customs, some steeped in ancient magic, while others forge brutal pacts with the Wilds’
          predators.
        </li>
        <li>
          Raw Magic: The land itself pulses with ancient, untamed power, twisting flora, fauna, and
          even the air into something alive and unpredictable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deadly Terrain: Shifting rivers, jagged cliffs, and choking forests make navigation a
          perilous gamble for outsiders.
        </li>
        <li>
          Primal Beasts: Terrible creatures stalk the Wilds, from towering apex predators to gro-
          tesque hybrids warped by magic.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>THE RUINS, A Fallen Empire</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Shattered Greatness: Once a realm of truly unmatched knowledge and power, now reduced to
          crumbling relics of its glory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Forgotten Relics: Ancient artifacts of magic and technology linger, broken or lost, yet
          still brimming with untapped potential.
        </li>
        <li>
          Corrupted Wasteland: Overgrown cities and desolate ruins seethe with decay, haunted by
          strange energies and whispers of the past.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eldritch Horrors: Nightmarish creatures lurk in the shadows—aberrations, cursed beings,
          and the tortured echoes of those consumed by the empire’s collapse.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>At this point, you probably have more questions than answers.</p>
      <p>That’s the point. You pose the questions, then you answer them.</p>
      <p>From this point forward, the Grimwild is yours to create.</p>
      <h3>SEASONS</h3>
      <p>
        Create custom months to add a fantastic touch to your world. Stick to a four-season cycle
        with three months per season, rolled on the tables below. Re-order the months as makes
        sense. For the first month, include three simple details like atmospherics, weather, or
        flora. When you reach another month, add three more for it. Add seasons as needed later in
        the campaign. Mix in fantasy elements!

      <h2>EXPLORATION SYSTEM</h2>
      <p>
        Exploration is played out with a token-based system that lets players and the GM work
        together to create and draw out the world. You gain exploration tokens, then spend them to
        add things to the map, giving each player equal opportunity to have an impact, while the
        spending of a resource adds weight to the contributions.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re creating a pointcrawl. A pointcrawl maps out the meaningful locations (points) and
        the connections (paths) between them, focusing on what really matters. Everything outside
        those paths? Either it’s tough to get through, or there’s nothing worth finding there. This
        approach keeps the spotlight on the places and journeys that drive the story, cutting out
        the tedium and keeping exploration sharp, deliberate, and packed with interesting things to
        experience.
      </p>
      <h3>EARNING TOKENS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          EXPAND THE MAP: When the GM uses the expand the map story move all players and the GM gain
          3 exploration tokens.
        </li>
        <li>
          Significant Discoveries: Earn 1+ tokens by discovering something meaningful when you
          actively explore or uncover key details of an area.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exchange Story: Spend story 1-for-1 to gain a token, but you have to connect it to a wise
          and explain how you knew about what you spent it on in-character.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>SPENDING TOKENS</h3>
      <p>
        Exploration tokens can be spent to add points and paths to the map. The token cost depends
        on the map type, covered over the next few pages. Generally, a minor point or path costs 1
        token and a major point or path costs 2 tokens. You use paths to draw connections between
        the points or to lead you off into unexplored territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each map type (region, settlement, site) has differences in how tokens are spent. Check
        those pages for specifics.
      </p>
      <h3>EXPAND THE MAP</h3>
      <p>
        The GM has a new story move called expand the map that encourages and makes time for
        exploration and mapping. It can be invoked at any time but must be used when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The adventuring party reaches the edge of the known map and cannot proceed without
          expanding it.
        </li>
        <li>There’s a natural narrative progression requir ing new points or paths to open up.</li>
        <li>
          Everyone’s just excited to add more to the map, like at the start or end of a session.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>When the GM uses this move:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Everyone (GM, too) takes 3 exploration tokens.</li>
        <li>
          Pull out the map and go around, in any order, adding points to the map until all tokens
          are spent. You cannot hoard tokens.
        </li>
        <li>
          New areas are added to the map, focusing on key points of interest and the connections
          between them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>JOY OF EXPLORATION</h3>
      <p>Take spark when you engage with the wonder of exploration as such:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Pause and take in the world around you. Let your roleplaying bring out a moment of
          beauty—what does your character notice, and how do they feel about it? Take spark when it
          creates a meaningful scene.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ask a question about the world that nobody knows the answer to, sparking curiosity in
          yourself and others. Encourage wonder. Take spark when the table embraces it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Travel somewhere far off, simply to see what’s there. Everyone on the journey takes spark.
        </li>
        <li>
          Highlight the unique nature of a place, even a seemingly mundane one. Make the scene about
          the location itself—exploration is at its heart. Take spark when you realize you’ll never
          forget that place.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>REGION MAPS</h3>
      <p>
        The Grimwild region map begins with squares along each border: the west are nearly
        impassible mountains, the east a long, cliffside coastline. The north is a heavy forest and
        the south a dire swamp. And throughout each of these is the fog, which you dare not exit—
        entering the fog will take you to one of the three realities, with no way to know which one.
      </p>
      <p>
        This creates a limited, but completely unknown sandbox to begin exploring. You enter on one
        side of this sandbox, drawing a path into it. From there, you begin your exploration. Spend
        tokens to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Token: Minor points and minor paths.</li>
        <li>2 Tokens: Major points and major paths.</li>
        <li>
          3 Tokens: Curiosities, barriers, and areas. Can also be called for by the GM (for free) to
          spice up the map, asking a player to add it or adding it themself.
        </li>
        <li>
          Free: Rough paths can be added for free, though they are difficult to traverse and
          generally dangerous. Passes can be added free as parts of a path. Waypoints are added to
          the path by the GM. Each represents 1 day of travel on that path.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you place something on the map, you always label it. This can be a simple evocative
        label of just a few keywords or even a name. If you aren’t sure, you can consult the
        crucibles on pg. 88 for ideas! You can also label it [Remnants] [Wilds] [Ruins] if you want
        to specify which reality it is mostly from.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you draw a path, the GM adds waypoints to it - dots that indicate 1 day of travel.
        Major paths have dots spread out further while minor paths have them closer. Rough paths
        don’t always have them if it’s unclear how long it will take—it can be possible to estimate!
      </p>
      <p>Here’s a list of everything you can add to the map:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Settlement: Places people live—towns, tribes, or villages.</li>
        <li>Site: Points of interest—dungeons, ruins, unique natural features.</li>
        <li>Danger: Hostile monsters, hazardous nature, or enemies.</li>
        <li>Curiosity: Unclear but intriguing signs or information waiting to be explored.</li>
        <li>
          Barrier: Obstacles to travel—rivers, mountains, cliffs. Only crossable via rough paths or
          passes.
        </li>
        <li>Area: Large, usually natural, spaces with a single theme—lakes, swamps, deserts.</li>
        <li>Major Path: Well-maintained roadways or trade routes.</li>
        <li>Minor Path: Lesser trails—footpaths, forest tracks, game trails.</li>
        <li>
          Rough Path: Difficult and dangerous terrain—overgrown paths, rocky trails, dry creek beds.
        </li>
        <li>Pass: Travel enablers—bridges, tunnels, mountain passes.</li>
        <li>Waypoint: Marker for 1 day’s travel (on horseback, under normal conditions).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To start off mapping a region, begin on one border and use the expand the map move. The GM
        draws a rough path into the region, then go through one or two rounds of expand the map.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add factions to the map and campaign as needed. There’s a factions crucible on pg. 88 to
        help.
      </p>
      <h3>SITE MAPS</h3>
      <p>
        The 5-Point Site technique, inspired by the 5-Room Dungeon concept, is used for mapping
        adventure locations. You create 5 points together using the same point cost rules as the
        region maps. Curiosities, paths, barriers, and areas can be added as well and don’t take up
        the 5 points.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must add one type of each of the 5 points below. The GM begins expand the map by adding
        the Reward point on the map first.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you place one of the points, describe it with a two word phrase— or use the
        settlements, sites, or dangers crucibles on the next page. You can either discuss them in
        detail as the map is drawn, leave it up to the GM to expand upon the phrases in play, or
        somewhere in-between. The GM decides what monsters, dangers, and challenges await within the
        site. Here are the 5 points to the map:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Entrance and Guardian: A challenge blocks the way—either a puzzle, trap, or guardian to
          over come. This point sets the tone and tests the adventurers’ mettle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Puzzle or Roleplay Challenge: A non-combat encounter that requires clever thinking,
          roleplaying, or teamwork. This point adds variety and deepens the narrative.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trick or Setback: Something unexpected catches the party off-guard—a betrayal, illusion,
          or hidden threat. This point keeps everyone engaged and on edge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Climactic Showdown: The dungeon’s central conflict—usually a big combat or intense
          encounter with high stakes. This point brings resolution or key rewards.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reward and Revelation: The loot, knowledge, or reward the party sought—but with a twist or
          hook for future adventures. This point ends with a memorable moment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>SETTLEMENT MAPS</h3>
      <p>
        Settlement maps are built with expand the map, but with a different drawing style. The GM
        begins by drawing the town’s outline, either as a vague border (a line, like a path) or as a
        wall (a barrier). You add roads and notable buildings following the rules to the right, and
        barriers, areas, curiosities, and passes as normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buildings are points of interest, with a significant NPC or unique function. Not writing a
        building down doesn’t mean it’s not there, it just means it’s unremarkable.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Road (1 Token): Draw a straight line between any two other lines on the map. These act as
          main roads.
        </li>
        <li>
          Building (2 Tokens): Draw a notable building within an empty space between roads on the
          map, generally in small areas you’ve created. Detail it or use the crucible below. You can
          also spend 3 tokens to add a major building, written on the map in CAPITAL LETTERS.
        </li>
